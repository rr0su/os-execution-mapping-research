# Week 1 — Day 2 Log

## Goal
Document the full compiler pipeline (preprocess → compile → assemble → link).

## Files analyzed
- code/hello.c
- experiments/hello.i
- experiments/hello.s
- experiments/hello.o
- experiments/hello.bin

## Notes
This experiment shows how a C program becomes assembly, then object code, then a final executable.
