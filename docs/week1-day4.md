# Week 1 — Day 4 Log

## Goal
Understand the ELF structure of a Linux binary produced by gcc.

## Files produced
- hello_elf_header.txt
- hello_program_headers.txt
- hello_section_headers.txt
- hello_symbols.txt
- hello_hex.txt

## What I learned
- Difference between program headers vs section headers.
- How the loader (ld.so) uses program headers.
- Where .text, .data, .rodata live.
- Basic layout of an ELF64 binary.
