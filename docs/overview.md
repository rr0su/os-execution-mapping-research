# Project Overview

This project is a focused 30-day research exploration of how source code is transformed into a running program on Linux. It documents the compiler pipeline (preprocess → compile → assemble → link), ELF internals, loader behavior, dynamic linking (PLT/GOT), virtual memory layout, calling conventions, and a small safe reverse-engineering suite.

Outputs:
- Reproducible experiments (code + outputs)
- Diagrams and annotated assembly
- A concise research report
